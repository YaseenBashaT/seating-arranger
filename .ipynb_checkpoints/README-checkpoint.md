# Abstract
In our college the tests and assignments will be conducted regularly, so whenever ther is an exam they have to make the seating plan which is somehow difficult. so instead of changing seating for every exam they used to follow the same seating plan for every exam.
watching the same people in every exam is kind of boring to me so i decided to create a tool that can randomly arrange the students so than we can sit beside new people in every assignment. 

# Technologies used:
In the website the frontend is created using **REACT**
Backend: **PYTHON FLASK**
database: **MONGO DB**

# How to deploy

clone the repository
open terminal at that folder

to deploy the project you have to create a database in mongodb its free to signin and add the database links in the [file main.py](main.py) 9th line 

To start react app run the following 
> npm i 
> npm run dev

To run server you have to install the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt
```
pip install --r requirements.txt

python main.py (or) 
py main.py (or)
